# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **ALICE LIU**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/light-gusty-bath?path=index.html%3A1%3A0) (https://light-gusty-bath.glitch.me/)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used the following sources: 
- W3Schools
- Boostrap
- Previous notes from Breakthrough Tech (BTT) where I learned introductory HTML, CSS, and JS

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge in creating this submission was first, having a refresher on HTML and CSS. Trying to get my feet back into these subject took a while but I eventually figured it out. Moreover, I learned new topics such as, implementing the javascript functions into the HTML file. Other challenges was  trying to understand the javascript code. Prior to this, I had very little experience with javascript. Even when I was in BTT, they briefly touched on the subject. Therefore, trying to understand the differences in syntax from other coding languages was an experiment and it required the reliance on outside resources such as W3Schools and Google to understand it. Coding the guess function on my own was a challenge as well. But for me, it was a nice way to understand previous code written and what each global variables was for. For me to overcome it, it took time to figure it out. Additionally, the diagram did contribute to writing the if statements and the different scenarios to consider. Overall, I learned a lot from this assignment. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions I have on web development is, while doing some research to understand how to complete some of the optional tasks, I came across terms such as HTTP 2.0 and HTTP 1.1. What are the differences? What are some advantages they have over each other? Moreover, I'm also curious as to how web developers are able to decrease the loading time when accessing a site. Another question I had while working on this assignment was trying to wrap my head around how people coded things to make it work interactively. For instance, when analyzing the sound frquency function, how did they code the oscillating? How did they associate that frequency number to actual sound frequency? Overall, I have several questions about the back end of the code. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project I would try to figure out the other optional tasks that were provided for us. Due to time constraints, I couldn't complete adding a ticking tock, speed it up, random pattern, and giving the player 3 strikes. I definitely wanted to learn more about javascript by figuring those tasks. Additional features I'd add to the game would be keeping records of game. To expand on it, I want the game to have increase the number of patterns with each play in addition with random pattern. The player try to beat their game record. When beated, there would be a notification of "new record".
